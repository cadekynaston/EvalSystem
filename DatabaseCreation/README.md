### Troubles Encountered During Database Set-Up
Hello Fall 2017 class! I wanted to let you know about a few of the problems we ran into with the database for this project. Let's start at the beginning of our semester. I was put in charge of creating the database, so I tried creating it first on my local machine. I started to do this, then I thought that it would be best to have it on the Titan server on Athena. In order to set it up on the Titan server I needed to get access for me and my group. I was told to go through Professor Rob Hilton, however I had a hard time getting him to email me back. So after about a week I contacted Patrick Beck and he helped set up a database for us on Titan as well as giving all of us access to it. At this point I was ready to run the script given to us by the last group and populate the database....so I thought.

After trying to run the Chitester-FullDump.sql, I quickly found that it was riddled with errors. Many items were dupolicated, and with the script being extremely large, it would crash. Next I tried running each of the individual files, and continued to get errors about duplicated items. The nice thing about these individual files is since they were much smaller in size, it wouldn't crash and it would store the non-duplicated items. After setting all of this up and looking at the screen shots from the previous group, I quickly realized that some of the tables were missing. So when I tried running the program it would crash because the queries were calling tables that did not exist.  To get around this we walked through each query and adjusted it to get the data from the information we were given. In all I spent about a month trying to get the database up and running.  After we had it running we had to make minor changes to the queries in the code to ensure that the correct infromation was being retrieved.

### Plans For Database Handoff To You
We are going to get with chitester and see if we can get a new full-dump.sql for you, if not I will create a script from our database and pass that along to you.  Just remember to get access and set the database up on the Titan server.  Just an FYI, you will be using MSSQL for the database. You will need to know that for whomever sets the database up for you on Titan. For me it was Patrick Beck, I had him call it "CS4450Fall2017." We created a new back-up sql file for you to use so you don't run into the same errors we had. The new file is Summer2017UseThis-CS4450Fall2017...

## Spring 2017
## Database Creation

This is the current local database we have been running our tests on. Once the project is closer to actually implementing on Chitester, make sure you get an updated database and update any sql queries that may need updating. The data that exists here is just made up test data, but is considered "live" data. The API that was built should reflect any changes made to this database. This is not "real" data, in that it does not contain actual results from evals, which we may or may not ever have access to, as it may be considered private.

The database we were using was updated, and we had to add a lot more test information, as well as tables to the database in order to get certain features to work. At some point, we may need to ask chitester to add these tables in order for some of the queries to function.

### Note about New Evals_DistractorTextAndScore Table

A Distractor is, essentially, an answer to a question on an eval.

When you enter in a new Distractor into the Distractors table, the "text" column usually looks something like:

```
1 (extremely poor)
2 (very poor)
3 (poor)
4 (average)
5 (good)
6 (very good)
7 (extremely good)
```

This is a very bad practice (does not pass first normal form as these data are not atomic) and slows down 
the math considerably.  This is because, when doing a query on this data, you will need to do string 
manipulation to get the scores separate from the text.  

The Evals_DistractorTextAndScore table was added to separate these data into two columns and speed up 
queries. When inserting a new row into the Distractors table you will also need to insert a row into the Evals_DistractorTextAndScore table.

The "distractorID" refers to "Distractors.ID".  When you join Distractors with 
Evals_DistractorTextAndScore you will get 2 new columns.

This query...
```
SELECT * 
FROM Distractors 
WHERE questionID = 961901;
```

Yields...
```
|ID      |questionID |sequence |formatID |correct |Distractors.text   |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
|3626242 |961901     |1        |1        |0       |1 (extremely poor) |
|3626243 |961901     |2        |1        |0       |2 (very poor)      |
|3626244 |961901     |3        |1        |0       |3 (poor)           |
|3626245 |961901     |4        |1        |0       |4 (average)        |
|3626246 |961901     |5        |1        |0       |5 (good)           |
|3626247 |961901     |6        |1        |0       |6 (very good)      |
|3626248 |961901     |7        |1        |0       |7 (extremely good) |
```

Joining in the new Evals_DistractorTextAndScore table will give more useful information for analytics 
without having to do string manipulation on potentially 10s of thousands of rows.  This process is much 
faster now, butyou will have to insert into Evals_DistractorTextAndScore whenever you insert into Distractors.

This query...
```
SELECT * 
FROM Distractors d
JOIN Evals_DistractorTextAndScore e
ON d.ID = e.DistractorID
WHERE questionID = 961901;
```

Yields...
```
|ID      |questionID |sequence |formatID |correct |Distractors.text   |score |e.text         |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|3626242 |961901     |1        |1        |0       |1 (extremely poor) |1     |extremely poor |
|3626243 |961901     |2        |1        |0       |2 (very poor)      |2     |very poor      |
|3626244 |961901     |3        |1        |0       |3 (poor)           |3     |poor           |
|3626245 |961901     |4        |1        |0       |4 (average)        |4     |average        |
|3626246 |961901     |5        |1        |0       |5 (good)           |5     |good           |
|3626247 |961901     |6        |1        |0       |6 (very good)      |6     |very good      |
|3626248 |961901     |7        |1        |0       |7 (extremely good) |7     |extremely good |
```

We would recommend completely abandoning the "Distractors.text" column, maybe just leave it null 
from now on.  ntext is depricated and is EXTREMELY slow.

Example INSERT...
```
INSERT INTO 
Distractors (questionID, sequence, formatID, correct, text                )
VALUES      (961901    , 1       , 1       , 0      , '1 (extremely poor)');

INSERT INTO 
Evals_DistractorTextAndScore (distractorID, score, text            )
VALUES                       (@@Identity,   1,     'extremely poor');
```

Or even ignoring the ntext value because it was bad practice and now redundant...
```
INSERT INTO 
Distractors (questionID, sequence, formatID, correct)
VALUES      (961901    , 1       , 1       , 0      );

INSERT INTO 
Evals_DistractorTextAndScore (distractorID, score, text            )
VALUES                       (@@Identity,   1,     'extremely poor');
```
